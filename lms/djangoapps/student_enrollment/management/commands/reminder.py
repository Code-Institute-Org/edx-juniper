A command that will notify zapier of any students that haven't logged in
to get access to the 5DCC yet.

This will be run every Tuesday morning at 09:30, giving the students a
24-hour period to log in before being notified.

This will simply get the locator for the 5DCC run that is currently
associated with the 5DCC program and will iterate over all of the
students that are enrolled in that run of the 5DCC and their email
address will be sent to Zapier, where HubSpot will take over the handling
of sending the emails to the students.
